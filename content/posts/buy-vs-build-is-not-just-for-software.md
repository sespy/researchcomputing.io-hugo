# Taking a fresh look at a persistent question

## Part 0

Anyone even occasionally wandering beyond the individual contributor role in IT has been faced with this notion: There is often a choice between buying and building software. And it is not a bad idea to go ahead and adopt a default setting of "Buy". Not a rule, mind you, rather a starting point for any given upcoming IT endeavor.

### Why?

It's cheaper. Usually. Sometimes a lot.

Creating software is easy. Creating big software can be hard.  And creating excellent software is borderline miraculous.


### Why not?

So making excellent software hard, so why would you EVER go it on your own?

No such solution exists: While there is a lot of surprisingly specify 3rd party solutions.[ mazing examples here ] not everything needed in the world of software has been created. And buying a big solution that includes one smaller set of functionality you need fails basic economic tests.

It's not just harder for YOU: Somebody wrote the software you buy and you can't assume that they were somehow magically better at writing software than the developers that your recruiters brought you. Your developers are not perfect, but neither are theirs.



That is a conversations that is important

Economics of solutions are the lowest common denominator in enterprise IT equations.

## Part 0

The dilemma is misunderstood, miscalculated, over-applied, and under-applied.


### misunderstood

Write a
It is not saying you don't need software developers.
integration becomes more critical
that s probably how you should write enterprise software anyway


### miscalculate4d

EG Prima



### over-applied

dont leave your oraganiztion without softrware developsrs.
"All companies are soft3warer companies"
avoiding wrinting an adampotrer or a feaature buy paying the company to... particularly fraught.

Example of over-application are low handing fruit, and are left as an exercise for homework.


### under-applied
This is the nut of this article.

It is applied to software - write or buy.

If it wasn't clear enough from the reasons just mentioned, it should become clear based on the
software defined networks
infrastructure as code
orchestration throuh kubernetes/foreman
docker

All of these are targets and best practices that describe how operations and infrastrutre can be and should be implemented as software, making the itutive leap more edxplicit. Buying operations vs. building operations.

Capabilities can be made or bought. If you are shrewdly avoiding reinventing the wheel when it comes to software, then devoting precious resouces to train your sysadmins on how to hand-craft a hadoop environment or manage all the hardware you are puchasing to host business applications, then you drawing a line where none exists.

If you have multiple employees that are nursing your own excahnge server, AD infrastructure, and sharepoint servers, make n o mistake, you are building and not buying.  This is not a mistake. This is not a bad strategy. but it does reflect a decision that should be made explitly, and not unde3r the misimpression that tthis is unrelated to your "Buy vs. Build" mandate.

If you think you enterpise is better at managing the information security needs of your infrastriucte better than the army of engineers at amazon, google, IBM, azure

### Intersting cases
Applying a teams energy to contributing to an open sourfce pject taht falls short of the needs of an enterpirse.
